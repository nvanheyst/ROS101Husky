- Practising publishers, specifically twist msgs
- Instructions were given in text format and tried to implement in a python script
- I learned how innacurate commands are without feedback (velocity command over time to get position) 


- driving_command_interval.py 			is the original with velocity commands over time
- instructionsforcomandsandintervals.txt  	contains instructions in text format
- odometry_feedback_test.py 			tests driving using odometry feedback - significantly more accurate
- odometry_subscriber.py		 	a simple subscriber to get odometry for debugging
